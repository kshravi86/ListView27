It is not because we sympathize with Nazism in any way, but because many of us are unaware of some aspects of WW-II (covered this in detail in the second part of the answer). \n" +

                "1. Horrors in Distant land\n" +
                "Think about this. Pick up an average European or American on the street and ask them about Pol Pot, Idi Amin, India's partition, Armenian Massacre, Rape of Nanking and Gulags. How many of these will ring a bell? All these events/people have killed 250K or more people each. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Most of us are unaware of the horrors in a distant land.\n" +

                "2. Indian experience\n" +
                "Schindler's List was a rude shock to me as the India where I grew up didn't teach me that part about the Nazis. It is one thing to read a term and another to feel it in an immersive way. Until secondary school, I had always thought Hitler was the good guy who was surrounded by a bunch of baddies. Then I started taking world history classes. Eventually I saw 50+ holocaust movies and visited holocaust museums. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Most Indians don't know enough to admire him, but don't know enough about his deadly nature either. In India, Hitler is commonly used to describe any tough disciplinarian. Other representations see him as funny, strong and almost like a school teacher. I once saw Hitler's photo for a school uniform store and bet that the owner doesn't know any bit of European history. Mein Kampf is a popular book in India, I know of a few in my close circles who have praised that book at some point.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. Reasons why Holocaust don't ring a bell\n" +
                "We don't have a big Jewish population to share their horror stories. That means WW-II was always some impersonal thing.  \n" +
                "Most Indians are unaware of the Holocaust. It has nothing to do with any propaganda. Given the state of history teaching in India, most Indians don't even know about our own history, let alone of some distant land. Once you become unaware of the terrible nature of the Holocaust, Hitler doesn't seem that bad in your eyes. In the same way, Europeans don't see India's partition or the Rape of Nanking in an emotional way like Indians and Chinese see, respectively. Blame it all on history education.\n" +
                "Unlike Europe and Americas, where Jews lived in constant shame even before Hitler's time, in India Jews lived normally. Thus, while the West was filled with guilt and shame (because Hitler only increased the suffering that was already present in the West), Indians couldn't get it.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Bollywood has no movies about Holocaust and our society is still very young and disconnected from WW-II. Our popular culture has a big impact on our understanding towards the world.\n" +
                "While Hitler was fighting UK, we Indians were against the Raj too. So, some Indians saw enemy's-enemy as their friend. Worse, some Indians even see the absolutely horrible Imperial Japan as some kind of a friend.\n" +
                "Hitler was also assumed to be \"soft\" towards Indian culture. People assume that he admired Sanskrit and Hindu symbols. This made him look good in contrast with other European leaders who don't give India its due respect & recognition. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "(A comedy family show titled \"Hitler\" sister meaning the \"tyrannical\" sister) \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Hitler brought Germany to the world's top in just a decade. That is fascinating for an Indian whose country has been filling up the bottom of the world's ranking for a century.\n" +
                "One of the popular revolutionary leaders in India - Netaji - sided with the Axis powers. To be fair, most of the world didn't know the horrors of the Holocaust at that time (before 1944) and saw the Axis powers merely as the challengers to the Anglican regime. Time froze given the early death of Netaji and some of his followers still cling to Japanese-German Axis. Had Netaji lived past 1945, it is very likely that he would realized how terrible his alliance was.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Summary\n" +
                "In short, some of us are completely ignorant of one of the most devious minds in human history, because he was way too distant for us & we are quite disconnected by the events of Holocaust. Also, to be fair all the 3 brands in the answer have since then changed their names to avoid any comical Hitler connections.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Also,  Hitler branding is used mostly in a comical way with a little bit of  \"shock\" effect that the marketers enjoy. It is like \"brand trolling\".  (In an unintentional way, becoming caricatured in Bollywood shows/Indian soaps/small shops is the ultimate insult for those rough Nazis. Being a laughing stock is always worse than being a strong villain.)");
