It is sexist to say that criminals and abusers cannot be women. But, that is an implicit assumption that some people don't challenge. Both men and women need to be concerned before going into a marriage - especially with total strangers. \n" +

                " Two guys in my extended family went through a really painful divorce soon after their marriage. They were really good guys who didn't deserve that. A son of my father's friend nearly died in domestic violence. If you are in upper middle class, you need to be as much afraid of the girl you are going to marry as she is going to be of you. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Some general tips that applies to everyone (guy and the girl):\n" +
                "Never rush into a marriage. Whether it is arranged or \"love\", spend a lot of time understanding the other side. Use your relatives to ask, enquire and connect with the other side. I know of some men, who didn't even bother to fly to their engagement. If you don't care about your life and care more about your depleting vacation balance, God save you.\n" +
                "Give yourself a minimum of 6 months before the wedding to uncover any serious issues in these social enquiries. Meet the bride and the family a lot of times in different social setups (restaurants, other weddings, picnics, parties). Build a social rapport and make sure you can live with them.\n" +
                "Pay a lot of attention to the family. Especially the Mother-in-law. If she is a dominating character, be very, very afraid. If your MIL hates you, God save you.\n" +
                "After the wedding, try to stay a year away from families of both sides. Move to a different country/city if possible. Build a strong one-on-one relationship without anybody else's interference. This will let you both understand each other when a 3rd party comes into the picture.\n" +
                "Always set a ground rule to never allow a 3rd party to come between the couple. Not your mother, her mother, your father, her father or whomever. All issues should be between the couple and a strong trust should grow.\n" +
                "Don't sleep with your job or marry your career. The job exists to serve you and not the other way around. When you are ready for marriage, be ready to spend a lot of time with your new family. If you spend enough time on your partner before wedding, you could uncover serious fault lines and if you spend enough time after wedding, you will reduce the chances of things blowing up.\n" +
                "Family comes higher than work. Make it a point to eat dinner with your spouse. As Winston Churchill said once, Jaw, jaw is better than war, war.  Expect the same of your partner too. If your partner is not interested in spending time with you, probably she/he is not that comitted. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Find out someone with whom you can confide your issues if things get serious. Don't deal with issues like domestic violence, alone.  Deal with serious issues early.\n" +
                "Finally remember, in majority of the cases you will do just fine. Millions of men and women carry a happy marital life. 100s of millions lead their marriage without dying in the process. Let the rare cases of crime not make you too paranoid that you fail to bond with the other human being who has left everything in the world to be with you.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Just because we are in a paternalistic society with 1000s of dowry deaths doesn't mean that crimes don't happen against men. While it is true that crime against women are 10X of crime against men that doesn't justify an apathy. Close to a 1000 men have been kidnapped/abducted and forced into a marriage in the past 3-4 years [1]. I'm sure this data is dramatically understated as men have a much more social stigma in reporting sexual crimes. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Just because you are man, you are not going to be invincible to a crime. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sexual crime against men is no myth!\n" +
                "When husbands are victims of domestic violence\n" +
