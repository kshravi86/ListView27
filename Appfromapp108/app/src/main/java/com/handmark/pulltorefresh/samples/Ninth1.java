                "Hitler wanted to occupy all of eastern and central Europe. However, there was a little issue. There were already people living in it. So, what would a Nazi do. Of course, plan to eliminate all of them. Here are the ethnicities they planned to remove from the face of the earth for the plan. They were able to execute a part of it, but before they could do it full, they were stopped.\n" +

Even Children were not spared. Even in neutral Swiss and Sweden 1000s went through forced sterlization. \n" +

                "Nearly 3 million Poles were put to death during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Some were Jews, but many were Christians.  Some were shot, some were starved, some were lost, some died of cold, some died in concentration camps, some died from exhaustion.\n" +

                "Jehovah's witness is an extreme flavor of Christianity who don't even celebrate Christmas citing it as pagan. Nazis persecuted them in case they didn't renounce their faith.\n" +

It is about one group of people who brought unspeakable horrors on the rest of humanity. Luckily for the world, Nazi rule lasted for just a decade. Imagine them ruling longer.  It is a sad reminder of how low human race had sunk during that period.\n");
