                "Things to carry:\n" +
                "I spent about Rs. 35000, but you could manage in lot less if you are very scrappy. Budget Rs. 1000 everyday for food, hotel and local travel.\n" +
                "1-2 bottles of water. India is not just hot, but many parts have sloppy water supply. Water is needed whether you get bruised by the dangling metal in the train, wash your eyes of the darn dust or get your throat cleared after the really spicy stuff.\n" +
                "Swiss knife and Hiking poles. Even if you don't hike, it will help for safety ;-)\n" +
                "Indian road atlas and railway timetable. Don't trust your iPhone apps as data availability can be very patchy. Don't spread your maps before random strangers though. \n" +
                "Water proof shoes that are comfortable. Carry extra pairs of socks.\n" +
                "Avoid DSLRs if you are not a professional photographer. They are not just very conspicuous for thieves, they can also slow you down.\n" +

                "Two key experiences:\n" +
                "Surprise sight of the Taj: One of the mornings, as I was sipping the tea on the train to Ujjain, I saw everyone turning towards my window. So, I turned around and was so pleasantly surprised. It was Taj Mahal on sunrise. I never knew that the train passed via Agra. So, I changed plans, packed up my bags and planned to get down at the next station. Alas, the train left me next at Bharatpur, Rajasthan :(\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Bathing at the Ganga: I went to Varanasi and did swim in the Ganges. I left all my possessions on the steps leading to the water. It was crazy, but I had no lockers. I was very worried if someone would take off with them, but luckily no one did. The recent floods had washed Ganga off all the crap and it was stunning. In the next 1 hour of bathing, I realized why the river is so celebrated over 5000 years. It was as though whole Indian history was running in front of me.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Bathin in Ganga after a huge flood was divine and I left all my possessions on the steps - not advisable. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Places covered:\n" +
                "I  went to Buddha's birthplace (Lumbini), place where he gave his first sermon (Sarnath) and got close to two other places where his life revolved.  For Krishna's myth, I started from Gokulam where he was, then to Mathura  where he grew up, then to Ujjain where he studied, to Dwarka where he  ruled. For Gandhi story, I went to Porbandar and Sabarmati.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I  took the following route: Chennai -> Puri -> Konark ->  Bhuvaneshwar -> Varanasi -> Lucknow -> Naimisaranya ->  Ayodhya -> Gorakhpur -> Crossed Nepal by foot ->Pokhara (Nepal)  -> Katmandu -> Mathura -> Ujjain -> Somnath -> Dwarka  -> Ahmadabad. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Crazy things:\n" +
                "From Gorakhpur to Nepal border, I went on a jeep with 25 other people. I'm claustrophobic and the trip was horrifying.\n" +
                "I crossed the India-Nepal border by foot in the middle of the night and stopped by the border security. He let me off with Rs. 100. I hope he doesn't let off terrorists this easily.\n" +
                "At Pokhara near Annapurna foothills in Nepal, I was stuck due to a big storm and completely ran out of money in a few days. There were no ATMs and places where they would accept credit cards. Then I got to Katmandu and had my dad transfer money to a local bank. \n" +
                "At Ayodhya, I was there during the famous court ruling. It was very tense. A couple of sadhus took me to some underground place where I met some random swami who was a leading local figure in destroying Babar Masjid. Felt a little scary as they looked a bit threatening. They asked for a donation that I politely refused. \n" +
                "On multiple occasions, people thought me of as wandering Sadhu (with 3-week old beards, beads and saffron kurtas). Of course, I could chant a few Vedic sukhtas to pass off as one but I didn't have to say anything. In Somnath, people took pictures of me and Kashi people got blessings on my feet. I got preferential train bookings in Gorakpur and the police often treated me with respect. [Indians are too religiously gullible].\n" +
                "\n" +
                "TIPS:\n" +
                "Never flaunt your gadgets or expensive items. Always travel like a broke student. Leave your gold bracelets, iPhones, Macbook etc at home.\n" +
                "Everyday let somebody know where you are traveling. Keep their contact number at the top your recently called list and also saved as \"emergency contact\" in your phone.\n" +
                "Wear conservative clothes (both guys & girls) and appear a part of the crowd. A Jean + T-shirt and an appearance of an urban middle class person is the safest.\n" +
                "Never appear confused in front of common public. Always ask for directions quietly and preferably from shopkeepers. Know that people are always watching you. I was once lost in a shady neighborhood in Amsterdam with pimps harassing me, but kept walking as though I knew the neighborhood, until I reached a place where I could safely ask for directions.\n" +
                "Never advertise your large plans. Tell people that you are going to the next city for studies or visiting friends.\n" +
                "Be prepared for constant alterations to your plans. In Puri, I met with the cyclone and had to alter all my forward plans.\n" +
                "Be very comfortable with Indian railways and how the overall booking stuff works. A couple of times I was mistaken for some wandering sadhu (with beard, long hair, saffron kurta and tilak) and given priority AC reservation.\n" +
                "Be very comfortable with street food. Carry some tablets for digestion, cold and fever, after consulting your doctor. \n" +
                "Travel by A/C 3-tier wherever possible. This helps you in getting into less crowded waiting rooms with slightly better bathrooms.\n" +
                "Keep money in at least 4 places. I kept a waist pouch for the frequent purchases, but it never had more than 1000 bucks.\n" +
                "Keep your eyes and ears open, while firmly shutting your biases. You might have lived all your life in India, but still might be ignorant of 99% of things.\n" +
                "Keep a couple of 100s ready. While I was crossing the Nepal land border in UP the middle of the night, the lone border guy wanted something. Even after protesting that I'm a wandering pilgrim, he would not let me without a Gandhi. Sometimes you need to adjust your principles in such long travels");
